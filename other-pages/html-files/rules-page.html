                        There will be times when we need to share your Personal Data with third parties. We will

                        your country. These countries may have laws different from what you are used to. Where Personal
                        Data are processed in
                        another country, we put safeguards in place to ensure your Personal Data remains protected.<br>

                        For individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA), this means that your data may be
                        transferred outside of the EEA.

                        where we have compliant
                        transfer mechanisms in place to protect your Personal Data, in particular, by implementing the
                        European Commission’s
                        Standard Contractual Clauses to the contracts with the entities the data is transferred
                        to.<br><br>

                        8. Security<br>

                        We are committed to protecting your Personal Data and have appropriate technical and
                        organizational measures in place,
                        including:<br>

                        o Data encryption. We encrypt all data that goes between you and us using industry-standard TLS
                        (Transport Layer
                        Security), protecting your personal and financial data. Your data is also encrypted when it is
                        stored on our servers,
                        and encrypted when we transfer it between data centers for backup and replication.<br>

                        o Limited access. We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors, and
                        agents who need that
                        information to process it.<br>

                        o Network protection. Multiple layers of security controls protect access to and within our
                        environment, including
                        firewalls, intrusion protection systems and network segregation. Our security services are
                        configured, monitored and
                        maintained according to industry best practices. We partner with industry-leading security
                        vendors to leverage their
                        expertise and global threat intelligence to protect our systems.<br>

                        o Secure data centers. Our servers are located within enterprise-grade hosting facilities that
                        employ robust physical
                        security controls to prevent physical access to the servers they house. These controls include
                        24/7/365 monitoring and
                        surveillance, on-site security staff and regular ongoing security audits. We maintain
                        geographically separated data
                        replicas to minimize the risk of data loss

                        or outages.<br>

                        o Security monitoring. Our security team continuously monitors security systems, event logs,
                        notifications and alerts
                        from all systems to identify and manage threats.<br><br>

                        9. Data Retention<br>

                        Some data you can delete whenever you like, some data is deleted automatically, and some data we
                        retain for longer
                        periods when necessary. When the data is being deleted, we make sure that your data is safely
                        and completely removed
                        from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. Information is retained until you remove
                        it<br>

                        We offer a range of services that allow you to correct or delete data associated with or stored
                        in your account. For
                        example, you can:<br>

                        o Edit information about yourself,<br>

                        o Delete a chat post, or<br>

                        o Delete your account entirely.<br>

                        We will keep this data in your account until it is not closed and for a period of five years to
                        allow us to meet our
                        regulatory and legal obligations and defend ourselves against any claims following the closure
                        of your account (when
                        applicable) or your last contact with us.<br>

                        Information retained for extended periods for limited purposes

                        Sometimes business and legal requirements oblige us to retain certain information, for specific
                        purposes, for an
                        extended period. For example, when a person self-excludes from our Services, we will retain the
                        Personal Data of this
                        person for longer periods as required for purposes of responsible gaming.<br>

                        Reasons we might retain some data for longer periods include:<br>

                        o to protect you, other persons, and us from fraud, abuse, illegal activity and unauthorized
                        access, for example, when
                        suspect someone is committing fraud, is engaged in match-fixing or launders money.<br>

                        o to comply with tax, anti-money laundering and other financial regulations, to carry out
                        accounting or facilitate
                        dispute resolution, for example, when we are party to a financial transaction, including

                        when we receive your deposits and make payouts to you.<br>

                        o to meet any comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental
                        request, or when we are
                        required to enforce the agreements, including investigation of potential violations.<br>

                        o to ensure the continuity of our Services to you and other users.<br>

                        o If you have directly communicated with us, for example, through a customer support channel or
                        providing feedback or a
                        bug report.<br>

                        We are committed to safeguarding the confidentiality of your personal information or data it
                        collects, uses and/or holds
                        following the applicable data protection laws and regulations and particularly, the provisions
                        of the (country) Data
                        Protection Laws and other applicable International Data Protection Regulations like the General
                        Data Protection
                        regulation of 2016/679 (GDPR) (hereinafter ‘Data Protection Laws’).<br><br>

                    <h3>Rules on sports</h3>
                    <p>
                        U1. AUSTRALIAN RULES FOOTBALL<br>

                        1. The bookmaker accepts bets:<br>

                        o on regular time of 80 minutes (four quarters of 20 minutes each or two halves of 40 minutes
                        each) )<br>

                        o on regular time including overtime (labeled “Including Overtime”).<br>

                        The bookmaker bears no responsibility for any inaccurate declaration of the duration of a match.
                        Details shown in the
                        “Sports” and “Live” sections are indicative only. The Customer should check the rules against
                        official sources.<br>

                        2. If a match is interrupted before the expiration of 80 minutes, all bets thereon will be
                        settled at odds

                        of 1, except for those markets which had already been unconditionally determined at the time the
                        match was interrupted.<br>

                        3. If a matching venue is changed then bets already placed will stand providing the home team is
                        still designated as
                        such.<br>

                        4. To Score First Goal. If the player has not participated in a match or is introduced as a
                        substitute after the first
                        goal has been scored, all bets on this player will be deemed void. Bets on players who had been
                        substituted or sent off
                        before the first goal was scored will lose. If the first goal is scored by a player on whom no
                        price has been offered,
                        all bets on other players will lose, except for the “Any Other Player” market. If a match has
                        been interrupted before
                        the first goal is scored, all bets will be canceled.<br><br>

                        2. AMERICAN FOOTBALL<br>

                        1. The bookmaker accepts bets:<br>

                        o on regular time (60 minutes of play consisting of four quarters of 15 minutes each);<br>

                        o on regular time including overtime (labeled “Including Overtime”).<br>

                        2. If a match starts but is not completed, all bets thereon will be settled at odds of 1, except
                        for those markets which
                        had already been determined at the time the match was interrupted.<br>

                        3. At least 55 minutes of play must elapse for bets to stand. In this event, all bets will be
                        settled based on the
                        results at the time the match was stopped.<br>

                        4. For bets on “Higher at The End of the Tournament” markets, if the teams fail to qualify from
                        the group, bets will be
                        settled based on their respective places within the group. If teams take equal places, bets will
                        be settled based on
                        their score.<br>

                        5. Highest Scoring Quarter. If it is impossible to determine the highest scoring quarter
                        unconditionally (i.e. if two or
                        more quarters end with the same score), bets on such quarters will be settled at odds of 1. Bets
                        on other quarters will
                        be deemed lost.<br>

                        6. Highest Scoring Half. If both halves end with the same score, bets will be settled at odds of
                        1.<br>

                        7. If a match including overtime ends in a draw, W1 and W2 bets will be settled at odds of 1
                        (stakes will be refunded),
                        while bets on total and handicap markets will be settled based on the match result.<br><br>

                        3. BADMINTON, TABLE TENNIS, BEACH VOLLEYBALL<br>

                        1. If the start of a match is delayed or postponed for any reason, all bets will stand until the
                        match or the tournament
                        in which the match features has concluded or until the withdrawal of one of the
                        participants.<br>

                        2. If a match is interrupted due to the withdrawal or disqualification of either team in the
                        first game/set, all bets
                        will be settled at odds of 1, except for those markets which had already been unconditionally
                        determined at the time the
                        match was interrupted. Bets on the match winner will be settled at odds of 1 in this case.<br>

                        3. No bet will be canceled because of a misprint in the initials of a sportsman/sportswoman (for
                        example, B. Smith
                        instead of A. Smith). In this event, bets will stand.<br>

                        4. "Match Winner". If any of the players named in the outcome is substituted before the start of
                        the match, all bets
                        shall be deemed void.<br>

                        5. Handicaps and totals for the aforementioned sports must be specified in points except for
                        “Handicap by Sets” and
                        “Total Sets” markets.<br>

                        6. "Winner". The sportsman/sportswoman (the team) who takes first place in the tournament will
                        be considered the winner.
                        If the sportsman/sportswoman withdraws from the tournament before it begins, bets on that
                        sportsman/sportswoman will be
                        settled at odds of 1.<br><br>

                        4. BASKETBALL<br>

                        1. The bookmaker accepts bets:<br>

                        o on regular time (the time of play may be 48 minutes consisting of four quarters of 12 minutes
                        each or 40 minutes
                        consisting of four quarters of 10 minutes each; NCAA – two halves of 20 minutes each);<br>

                        o on regular time including overtime (labeled “Including Overtime”). Bets on Stats include OT
                        unless stated otherwise.
                        Other betting terms may be specified in the betting section.<br>

                        2. If a match starts but is not completed, all bets on the match will be settled at odds of 1,
                        except for those markets
                        which had already been determined at the time the match was interrupted.<br>

                        3. If the duration of a match is 40 minutes, at least 35 minutes must be played for bets to
                        stand. If the duration of a
                        match is 48 minutes, at least 40 minutes must be played for bets to stand. In these cases, all
                        bets will be settled
                        based on the results at the time the match was interrupted.<br>

                        4. NBA teams may be shown in direct order (home-away), as well as in a reversed order. If the
                        latter is the case, no
                        stakes are refunded.<br>

                        5. The Customer should check the rules of basketball friendlies (whether a cup or club
                        friendlies) through official
                        sources. If friendly ends in a draw (the rules of the match have been changed), bets on the
                        winner will be settled at
                        odds of 1. However, bets on total and handicap markets will be settled on the result.<br>

                        6. In basketball cup matches, the overtime awarded based on the aggregate results of two matches
                        only counts for the “To
                        Qualify for The Next Round”, “To Qualify for Another League”, “Winner” and similar markets.<br>

                        7. If a basketball match ended in a draw, the “Will There Be Overtime? - Yes” bet wins and the
                        “Will There Be Overtime?
                        - No” bet loses.<br>

                        8. "Half-Time/Full-Time". In the “Sports” section “W” stands for the win and “X” stands for the
                        draw. The outcome of the
                        first half is specified first and is followed by the outcome after regular time. For example,
                        W1W2 means that the first
                        team (W1) will win the first half and the second team (W2) will win the match in regular
                        time.<br>

                        9. "Highest Scoring Quarter". If the highest-scoring quarter is impossible to determine
                        unconditionally (i.e. when two
                        or more quarters have ended with the same result), bets on such quarters will be settled at odds
                        of 1. Bets on оther
                        quarters will lose (when the total of the fourth quarter is settled, no points scored in
                        overtime will count).<br>

                        10. "Highest Scoring Half". If both halves have ended with the same result, bets will be settled
                        at odds of 1 (when the
                        total of the second half is settled, no points scored in overtime will count).<br> 11."Team...
                        To
                        Win Both Halves – Yes".
                        When the total of the second half is settled, no points scored in overtime will count. "Team...
                        To Win Both Halves –
                        No". The bet will win if the team specified has drawn or lost at least one half.<br>

                        12. "Each Team Will Score Over 72.5 – Yes". The bet will win if the total scored by each team
                        during the match amounts
                        to 73 or more.<br>

                        13. "Each Team Will Score Over 72.5 – No". The bet will win if at least one of the teams has not
                        reached the quoted
                        total.<br>

                        14. "Total For Each Quarter Over 32.5 – Yes". The bet will win if the total number of points
                        scored in each quarter is
                        33 or more.<br>

                        15. "Handicap By Quarters". For example, “2 Handicap By Quarters -2.5”. The final score is
                        81:102 (17:22, 26:25, 18:20,
                        20:35), the score by quarters is therefore 1:3 (0:1, 1:0, 0:1, 0:1 respectively). The bet loses
                        as when the handicap to
                        Team 2 is applied, the score by quarters is 1:0.5.<br>

                        16. "Winning Margin 6-10". Bet will win if the score margin is within the range of 6-10 points.
                        For example: the match
                        score is (85:90), the score margin is 5 points – the bet "Winning Margin 6-10" will
                        lose.<br><br>

                        5. BASEBALL, SOFTBALL<br>

                        1. Bets on baseball matches are accepted on the regular time unless otherwise stated.

                        The names of the starting pitchers will be taken into consideration at the time of bet
                        acceptance if the names are
                        specified concerning the event. Both listed pitchers must start and each pitch at least once for
                        bets to stand. If any
                        of the listed pitchers fail to start for any reason, all bets on this game will be deemed void.
                        If the starting pitchers
                        are not listed, bets will be accepted regardless of who those starting pitchers are.<br>

                        2. The team which bats at the bottom of an inning shall be treated as the home team
                        notwithstanding the venue of the
                        game.<br>

                        3. All bets are settled on the official match results including all extra innings (except bets
                        made on the parts of the
                        match).<br>

                        4. All bets stand if at least five full innings or 4.5 innings have been played. If fewer than
                        4.5 innings

                        have been played, the bookmaker will settle bets on the “Team To Win” and “To Qualify For The

                        pre-match bets are subject to

                        For example, Grönefeld/Peschke – Niculescu/Zakopalová. Total Under 21.5. The score is (6:3,
                        3:81, 4:10 points). The

                        In certain tournaments, a super tie-break (champion's tie-break) is played instead of a final
                        deciding set. The player
                        (pair) who first scores 10 points will be declared the winner of the match provided that they
                        beat their opponent by at
                        least a two-point margin.<br>

                        9. "Correct Score" (score based on sets). The respective bets in the “Sports” section are 2:0,

                        11. "Win In The Game". The Customer should determine who will win the specified game. Games
                        within each set are numbered
                        consecutively. For example, if the 2nd set ended with a score of 6:1, bets on the “8th Game 2nd
                        Set” will be settled at
                        odds of 1 as there has been no eighth game.<br>

                        12. A tie-break will be regarded as a single separate game.<br>

                        “W 1/2 With Any Other Score”. This bet implies that a player will win a tie-break after a score
                        of 6:6 (or a super
                        tie-break after a score of 9:9).<br>

                        Example 1. Klein (Australia) vs. Klec (Slovakia). W1 With Any Other Score.

                        o The tie-break ends with the score (7:3) – the bet loses.

                        o The tie-break ends with the score (8:6) – the bet wins (as Player 1 won after a score of
                        6:6).<br><br>

                        (“extra time”).<br>

                        Extra time and penalty shootouts will only count for the markets “To Qualify (For The Next

                        check the rules against
                        independent sources of information before placing bets on friendlies.<br>

                        and UEFA European

                        8. “More Corners – Team”. Which team will take the most corner kicks in the match?<br>

                        9. “Total Corners Over/Under”. The Customer should predict whether the total number of corner
                        kicks in the match will be

                        10. Bets on Yellow Card. Yellow Card total, Yellow Card handicap – only warnings to field
                        players and the goalkeeper are
                        counted. When counting the number of yellow cards in a match, a second warning that resulted in
                        the automatic player
                        sent-off, is not taken into account. Yellow and red cards shown to the field players and the
                        goalkeeper after the final
                        whistle will not count towards bet settlement.<br>

                        11. Bets on “Yellow/Red Card” (also referred to as YRC or Cards) will be settled in the
                        following manner: a yellow card
                        is counted as one card; a red card is counted as two yellow cards. The second yellow card for
                        the same player will not
                        be counted and will be regarded as one red card. This means that one player can have a maximum
                        of three cards per match.<br>

                        12. The number of yellow and red cards, corner kicks and hits of the crossbar/posts will be
                        determined subject to video
                        footage. In the event of a lack of video footage, or its interruption, the number of yellow and
                        red cards and corner
                        kicks will be taken from official sources. A substitution made in the 46th minute according to
                        the official source will
                        be regarded as a substitution made in the half-time break. A corner kick that was retaken will
                        be regarded as just one
                        corner kick for bet settlement purposes. Only those corner kicks which have been taken will
                        count towards the settlement
                        of bets on Total Corners.<br>

                        13. Bets on penalty shootouts. If the fifth penalty kick is not taken in a penalty shootout,
                        then the following markets
                        will be refunded:<br>

                        “Team 2 To Score Their 5th Penalty - No”;<br>

                        “Team 2 To Score Their 5th Penalty - Yes”.<br>

                        14. “Player To Score First Goal And Team To Win With The Score”.<br>

                        The Customer should predict which player will score the first goal and the score at the end of
                        regular time (including
                        stoppage time). If a player does not participate in the match or is introduced as a substitute
                        after the first goal has
                        been scored, bets will be settled at odds of 1. If the first goal is own

                        (a player scores in their own team’s net), bets on the player who has scored this goal will be
                        settled at odds of 1. If
                        a match is interrupted after the first goal has been scored and is not concluded within the
                        timeframe stipulated in the
                        rules, bets on the player who scored this goal will be settled at odds of 1.

                        Bet 1 “Adam Lallana To Score First Goal And Team 1 To Win With The Score 1-0 - yes” Bet 2 “Dejan

                        Goal And Team 1 To Win With The Score 1-0 - yes” ”<br>

                        Example 1.

                        Adam Lallana scored the first goal and Team 1 won with a score of 1-0:

                        bet 1 wins;

                        bet 2 losses.<br>

                        Example 2.

                        Adam Lallana did not enter the field of play and Team 1 won with a score of 1-0:

                        a stake of bet 1 is refunded;

                        bet 2 losses.<br>

                        15. Cards. Statistics. Bets will be settled depending on the events during regular time. No card
                        will count unless it is
                        shown to a player on the pitch.<br>

                        First Card. Bets will be settled on what occurred in the designated interval of the match. A red
                        or yellow card must be
                        shown in the designated interval. No card will count if an infraction which later resulted in a
                        caution (or dismissal)
                        happened in the designated interval, but the card was shown after the designated interval.<br>

                        Total Cards. Bets will be settled including added (stoppage) time. Extra time will not count
                        unless otherwise stated.
                        Only one card will count for a second bookable offense. This means that if a yellow card is
                        immediately followed by a
                        red card, only one card will count for betting purposes. Accordingly, a player may not receive
                        more than two cards per
                        match.<br>

                        Last Card. If there are no cards in the match, the selection “No Cards” will win. All other bets
                        will lose. If two or
                        more players are involved in a single incident, the market will be settled based on the last
                        card shown.<br>

                        16. Bet "Team 1 will score its first goal before 78:00 minutes - Yes" - the Customer should
                        predict that the 1st team
                        will score its first goal within this period of time. If a goal is scored in the 78th minute, it
                        will be taken into
                        account when calculating this bet.<br>

                        17. "Penalty and sent-off – Yes". The bet will win if there was both a penalty and a sent-off in
                        the game.<br><br>

                        2. Extra time and penalty shootouts from the 6-meter mark will only count for the following
                        markets: qualifying for the
                        next round, winner of the tournament, and similar.<br>

                        3. If a match starts but is not completed, all bets thereon will be settled at odds of 1, except
                        for those markets which

                        scores the specified number of points, bets will be settled at odds of 1.<br>

                        determined before the
                        completion of a match for any reason, bets on sets will be deemed void

                        unless further play affects the result.<br>

                        2. If the winner has been determined before all sets are completed, bets on the winner of the
                        match will be settled
                        based on the official result provided that at least one end has been played to its

                        better. The driver who
                        finishes in the higher place in the race (in the final classification) will be deemed to have
                        performed better.<br>

                        Both drivers must start the race for bets to stand. If both drivers fail to finish, bets will be
                        settled based on the
                        number of laps completed.<br>

                        If both drivers retire from the race, the driver who has completed more laps will be deemed to
                        have performed better. If
                        both drivers retire after an equal number of laps, bets will be settled at odds of 1. If a
                        driver fails to complete
                        their fastest lap (fail to show the qualification time), their place shall be determined based

                        international terrorism (AML
                        Policy). At the same time, we maintain a strong and principled position on the prevention of all
                        kinds of illegal
                        activities, as well as all related regulations. To fulfill these obligations, we are obliged to
                        inform the corresponding
                        official authorities if there are reasons to suspect that the funds deposited by you are related
                        to money laundering or
                        terrorism financing activities. We will also be obliged to block such User's funds, as well as

                        obtained in exchange for
                        such property),

                        the conversion, transfer, receipt, possession or use of property obtained through criminal
                        activity (or property

                        spread of crime, many
